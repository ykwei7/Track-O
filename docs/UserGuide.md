Track-O is a **desktop app for private tutors to manage their tutees**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Track-O lets you track an assortment of data, from grades to home addresses to lesson timings. You can easily access the many functions of Track-O using simple commands, such as add and get. Hop over to our Quick Start section to get started.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `tracko.jar` from here.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ to run Track-O.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will prompt the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list`** : Lists all tutees.

    * **`add`**`n/John Doe l/P5: Adds a contact named John Doe of level P5` to the Address Book.

    * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the tutee list.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.  [To be released]

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
