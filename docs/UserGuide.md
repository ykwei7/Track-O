<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Quick start

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
 
2. Download the latest `Track-O.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases/download/v1.4/CS2103T-F12-3.Track-O.jar).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ to run Track-O.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds as shown in the image below. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

    <p align="center">
        <img src="sample_ug.png" width="95%"/>
    </p>

5. Refer to [Setting up your first tutee](#setting-up-your-first-tutee) to get started using Track-O.

If you need help with the start up process, visit our [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Application layout

![gui_layout.png](gui_layout.png)

The GUI of Track-O is divided mainly into 4 sections:
- `Menu Bar`: Navigation buttons that you can click to exit Track-O or open up a `help` window containing a link to this User Guide. 
- `Tutee list`: A scrollable panel that shows a numbered list of your tutees.
  - The index number of the tutee list is the number that is assigned to each tutee in the numbered list.
- `Command box`: A text box where you can type in commands and hit the Enter key on your keyboard to execute them.
- `Result panel`: A scrollable panel that shows the result of the command that you have just executed.
  - Note that some commands such as `get` will show a particular tutee's lessons in the form of a numbered list. Similar to the tutee list, the index number of a tutee's lesson refers to the number assigned to each lesson in the numbered list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Setting up your first tutee

This section provides a quick guide to adding your first tutee and carrying out your first lesson. For more information
on each command, it can found under the [Features](#features) section of our guide. To run a command, simply type the command in the command box and hit the Enter key on your keyboard.

#### Before your lesson
1. Let's clear the existing sample data first. Run `clear` to remove the existing tutees.
2. To add in a new tutee, run `add n/John Tan l/p5 a/246 Hougang Ave sch/Rosyth School p/84567890`.
This will add in a tutee with the name `John Tan`, a `Primary 5` student from `Rosyth School`, staying at `246 Hougang Ave` whose phone number is `84567890`.
3. To add a lesson for this tutee, run `addlesson 1 subject/English d/7 s/14:00 e/16:00 rate/30`.
This will add an `English` lesson from `Sunday 2pm to 4pm` with the rate of `$30` per hour for John.
4. To state a payment receive date, run `payment 1 by/05-01-2022`. This means that you expect to collect the fees on
the 5th of January 2022.
5. Run `get 1`. If you performed all the steps correctly, the application should look like this.

<img src="john_ug.png" width="85%"/>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### After your lesson
1. To add in the fees of this lesson, run `payment 1 lesson/1`. This will add in the total fees of the first lesson. Since
the rate was `$30` per hour over 2 hours, the total adds up to `$60.00`.
2. To add in any remarks for the lesson, run `remark 1 r/Good Progress!` and this set the comments `Good Progress!`
under John's remarks.
3. If you have collected the fees for this lesson, run `payment 1 receive/` and this resets the payment value to `0.00`,
removes the pay-by date used in step 4 under [Before your lesson](#before-your-lesson), and updates John's last paid date to today's date.
4. Run `get 1`. If you performed all the steps correctly, the application should look like this.

## Features

This section covers the various features of **Track-O**. 

Our main features includes storing the information of tutees, scheduling lessons and managing payments of tutees.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
e.g. `[t/TAG]…` tags are optional can be added multiple times: `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.<br>
e.g. `[subject/SUBJECT…]` subject keywords are optional and allows multiple keyword search: `subject/English Math Science`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `schedule`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Track-O home folder (`tracko.json`).

**Q**: I opened my application and all my data is gone! What do I do?<br>
**A**: The data is most likely corrupted. If you are familiar with how to edit `json` files, you may open your `tracko.json` file to make the necessary edits. Otherwise, you would have to delete the existing `tracko.json` file and start afresh.

**Q**: Why does my application look slightly different?<br>
**A**: The screenshots in this User Guide are from an application running on macOS. If you are using Windows, your application would look something like this instead:

<img src="windows_ug.png" width="85%"/>

It is just a visual difference. Both applications have the same functionalities otherwise.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Q**: What are tags used for? <br>
**A**: Tags can be used to indicate important details of the tutee that you would like to see straight from the `tuteelist`. For instance, in the sample data provided, tags were used to indicate important upcoming examinations for tutees such as `PSLE`. 

**Q**: What does it mean by a lesson clashing with other lessons in the user's schedule under the section on [adding a lesson to a tutee](#adding-a-lesson-to-a-tutee--addlesson)? Why is it not allowed?<br>
**A**: A schedule clash means that the lesson added coincides with another lesson in the existing schedule. To resolve this, pick a different day/timing where your schedule is free.

**Q**: Why doesn't pressing `F1` open the Help menu on my Mac?<br>
**A**: Try pressing `Fn` + `F1` (The Function and the F1 key together) instead. This is due to how macOS handles function keys.

## Glossary

Terms | Explanation
--------|------------------
operating system | The system software that manages computer hardware.
command | The text that you enter in the command box. Different commands have different formats.
prefix | A word or letter that ends with `/`. It is a shorthand notation that is used to specify the fields involved in a command. e.g. `n/` indicates that a name is involved.
parameter | A value that is defined based on your input and is immediately preceded by a prefix. e.g. Given a `p/` prefix which represents a phone number, followed by a `PHONE` parameter; if you input `98765432` in place of the `PHONE` parameter, the phone number holds a value of `98765432`.
